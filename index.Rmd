## Births and Fertility
 - Singapore has one of the lowest fertility rates globally [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=SG).
 
### Crude Birth Rate

```{r crude birth rate data, warning=FALSE}
crude_birth_rate <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/crude-birth-rate.csv")
```

The crude birth rate is the annual number of live births per 1,000 population (WHO). But the calcuation used by Singapore is the number of live births in a given year, per thousand mid-year population.

```{r crude birth rate plot, warning=FALSE}
crude_birth_rate %>% 
  gg_line(x_var = year,
          y_var = value,
          title = "Crude Birth Rate (per 1,000 popultaion)",
          y_title = "",
          x_title = "",
          caption = "Graphic: @wyuet. Source: data.gov.sg",
          theme = theme_light())
```

## Number of Live Births

```{r live births data, warning=FALSE}
live_births <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/live-births.csv")

#Convert value from chr to dbl
live_births$value <- as.double(as.character(live_births$value))
```

Live-births are defined as occurring within Singapore and its territorial waters as registered under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act (Chapter 267). Data are compiled based on date of occurrence.


```{r live births plot, warning=FALSE}
live_births %>% 
  filter(level_1 == "Total Live-births") %>% 
  gg_line(x_var = year,
          y_var = value,
          title = "Number of live births",
          y_title = "",
          x_title = "",
          caption = "Graphic: @wyuet. Source: data.gov.sg",
          theme = theme_light())
```

## Total Fertility Rate by Ethnic Groups

```{r fertility rate ethnic group data, warning=FALSE}
total_fertility_rate_by_ethnic_group <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/total-fertility-rate-by-ethnic-group.csv")
```

The Total Fertility Rate refers to the average number of live-births each female would have during her reproductive years if she were to experience the age-specific fertility rates prevailing during the period. It is derived by aggregating the age-specific fertility rates of females in each of the reproductive ages for a specific year.

```{r fertility rate ethnic group plot, warning=FALSE}
total_fertility_rate_by_ethnic_group %>% 
  gg_line_col(x_var = year,
              y_var = value,
              col_var = level_2,
              title = "Total Fertility Rate by Ethnic Groups",
              y_title = "",
              x_title = "",
              col_title = "",
              caption = "Graphic: @wyuet. Source: data.gov.sg",
              theme = theme_light())
```

## Total Fertility Rate by Age Groups

```{r fertility rate age group data, warning=FALSE}
age_specific_fertility_rate <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/age-specific-fertility-rate.csv")

#convert value from chr to dbl
age_specific_fertility_rate$value <- as.double(as.character(age_specific_fertility_rate$value))
```

Total Fertility Rate by Age Groups refer to the number of live-births to females in a particular age group, per thousand females in that age group during the period.

  - Data prior to 1980 pertain to total population.
      
  - Data from 1980 onwards pertain to resident population (i.e. Singapore citizens and permanent residents).

```{r fertility rate age group plot, warning=FALSE}

age_specific_fertility_rate %>% 
  gg_line_col(x_var = year,
              y_var = value,
              col_var = level_2,
              title = "Total Fertility Rate by Age Groups",
              y_title = "",
              x_title = ,
              col_title = "",
              caption = "Graphic: @wyuet. Source: data.gov.sg",
              theme = theme_light())
```

## Housing

  - Being an island state, land is limited, and thus housing is a perennial issue.

  - The majority of people live in public housing, and the term evokes a different image compared to other countries.
  
  - A small proportion of people live in private landed properties.
