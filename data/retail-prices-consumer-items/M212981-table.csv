Definitions,,,,,,
Expenditure:,,,,,,
"Refer to consumption expenditure incurred by households. Household consumption expenditure is the value of consumer goods and services acquired, used or paid for by a household for the satisfaction of the needs and wants of its members. Non-consumption expenditure such as loan repayments, income taxes, purchase of houses is excluded. The consumption expenditure on owner-occupied accommodation is estimated using the rental equivalence method, which measures the shelter cost in terms of the expected rental the owner would have to pay if he were a tenant of the premises. It is estimated based on the Annual Assessed Values (AAVs) provided by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). The imputed rental of owner-occupied accommodation is included when analysing the detailed share of household expenditure by goods and services.",,,,,,
Type of Goods and Services :,,,,,,
"Expenditure by the type of goods and services are classified according to the Singapore Classification of Individual Consumption according to purpose (SCOICOP). In line with the principles of the United Nations (UN) COICOP, the SCOICOP categorises consumption expenditures according to their primary “functions” or “purposes”. Broad divisions include: “Food & Non-Alcoholic Beverages”, “Food Serving Services”, “Housing & Utilities”, “Health”, “Transport”, “Communication” etc.",,,,,,
