# A project to visualise publicly available data published by the government in Singapore

Data.gov.sg was launched in 2011 as the government's one-stop portal to its publicly-available datasets from 70 public agencies.
  
  - a personal project
  
  - find insights from making visualizations
  
  - Singapore is a small country facing unique challenges
  
  - all data from data.gov.sg, available under the Singapore Open Data License
  
  - The Singapore Open Data Licence aims to promote and enable easy reuse of Public Sector data to create value for the community and businesses

# Births and Fertility
 - Singapore has one of the lowest fertility rates globally (World Bank, WHO)
 
## Crude Birth Rate Data

```{r}
crude_birth_rate <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/crude-birth-rate.csv")

```

### Plot Crude Birth Rate

#### The crude birth rate is the annual number of live births per 1,000 population (WHO). But the calcuation used by Singapore is the number of live births in a given year, per thousand mid-year population.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
crude_birth_rate %>% 
  gg_line(x_var = year,
          y_var = value,
          title = "Crude Birth Rate (per 1,000 popultaion)",
          caption = "Graphic: @wyuet Source: data.gov.sg",
          theme = theme_bw())

```

## Number of Live Births

```{r, warning=FALSE}
live_births <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/live-births.csv")

#Convert value from chr to dbl
live_births$value <- as.double(as.character(live_births$value))
```

### Plot Number of Live Births

```{r, warning=FALSE}
live_births %>% 
  filter(level_1 == "Total Live-births") %>% 
  gg_line(x_var = year,
          y_var = value,
          title = "Number of live births",
          y_title = "",
          caption = "Graphic: @wyuet Source: data.gov.sg",
          theme = theme_bw())
```

## Total Fertility Rate by Ethnic Groups

```{r, warning=FALSE}
total_fertility_rate_by_ethnic_group <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/total-fertility-rate-by-ethnic-group.csv")
```

### Plot Total Fertility Rate by Ethnic Groups

#### The Total Fertility Rate refers to the average number of live-births each female would have during her reproductive years if she were to experience the age-specific fertility rates prevailing during the period. It is derived by aggregating the age-specific fertility rates of females in each of the reproductive ages for a specific year.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
total_fertility_rate_by_ethnic_group %>% 
  gg_line_col(x_var = year,
              y_var = value,
              col_var = level_2,
              title = "Total Fertility Rate by Ethnic Groups",
              y_title = "",
              col_title = "",
              caption = "Graphic: @wyuet Source: data.gov.sg",
              theme = theme_bw())

```
