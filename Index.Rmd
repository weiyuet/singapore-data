crude_birth_rate <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/crude-birth-rate.csv")

```

### Plot Crude Birth Rate

crude_birth_rate %>% 
  gg_line(x_var = year,
          y_var = value,
          title = "Crude Birth Rate",

live_births <- read_csv("data/births-and-fertility-annual/live-births.csv")

#Convert value from chr to dbl
live_births$value <- as.double(as.character(live_births$value))
```

### Plot Number of Live Births

```{r, warning=FALSE}
live_births %>% 
  filter(level_1 == "Total Live-births") %>% 
  gg_line(x_var = year,
          y_var = value,
          title = "Number of live births",
          y_title = "",
          caption = "Source: data.gov.sg",
          theme = theme_bw())
